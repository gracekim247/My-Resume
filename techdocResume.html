      <!-- ABOUT ME -->
      <header>About Me</header>
      <p>Hi! My name is Grace :P I spent a year at Boston College studying Computer Science BS and Biology BS. After my first year, I decided to go on a gap year to possibly transfer to a different school. Soooo here I am nearing the end of my gap year :'( but that's okay because I've been very bored at home. Which is why I started this online web design certification course. This is my third certification project: a documentation page. I'm using this project as an opportunity to make an online/interactive documentation page-style resume. Enjoy <3 </p>
      <p>Update (10/17/2023): I am now a student at Queens College studying CS!</p>
      <p>Update (04/11/2024): I am still a CS student at Queens College!</p>
      <p>Update (10/29/2024): I landed my first software engineer internship this past summer (summer 2024) because of this project. 
        Recruiter was very impressed! So I thought I'd share this project with GWC through an HTML/CSS Workshop happening on Nov. 6, 2024!</p>
